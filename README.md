## Setup

### First Steps

1. Clone the repository and initialize submodules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leafyzito/jsFolhinha.git
cd jsFolhinha
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials

### Development Mode

For development and testing without all services:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Mode (Docker)

For running the complete application with all services (including [Cobalt](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/) and [Twitch Clipper](https://github.com/leafyzito/twitch-clipper)):

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed

2. Ensure the environment variable ENV is set to 'prod' in docker-compose.yml (or 'dev' for testing)

3. Start the application:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop the application:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Status Endpoint

The bot includes a built-in HTTP status server for monitoring and uptime tracking:

### Endpoint

- **`/`** - Detailed status with uptime information

### Configuration

The status server runs on port 3000 by default. You can customize this by setting the `STATUS_PORT` environment variable:

```bash
STATUS_PORT=8080
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "uptimeFormatted": "1h 0m 0s",
  "startTime": 1703123456,
  "currentTime": 1703127056,
  "isReady": true
}
```

This endpoint is perfect for uptime monitoring services like UptimeRobot, Pingdom, or any other monitoring tool.
